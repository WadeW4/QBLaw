				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>VA benefits are getting better.</strong></p>
<p>One of the best kept secrets in long term care planning is the Veterans Pension with Aid and Attendance program. Aid and Attendance is a benefit available to veterans, their spouses, widows or widowers. <strong>Of all the VA benefits, this offers the highest level available and is designed to help offset the cost of nursing homes, assisted living communities, and personal care homes.</strong> A claimant is in need of aid and attendance if they need regular aid and attendance from another person.</p>
<p>A claimant is presumed to be in need of aid and attendance if they are a patient in a nursing home due to mental or physical disability. As of December 1, 2012, all recipients of these VA benefits received a small raise.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2012, VA benefits were increased 1.7%. <strong>The following is a maximum monthly benefit amount allowed for the Aid and Attendance pension level. </strong>Benefits are paid directly to the claimant and are retroactive to the date of application. Payments are tax free. Here are the new rates:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-569" alt="VA benefits improving in 2013" src="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2013-02-benefits-numbers.png" width="425" height="141" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The VA is a large and slow organization with many complicated rules. </strong>If their forms are not completed correctly when your application is turned, along with the right supporting documentation, it may delay your benefits for over a year. If you or a loved one is interested in how VA benefits can help you, give us a call to learn more about these benefits and how they can help you.</p>

<p>What does a Will do, what does a Trust do, and do you need both? Most people are unaware of the important distinctions. Here we clear up the confusion. Learn the difference between Wills versus Trusts and why they&#8217;re both important.</p>
<p>Many estate planning clients start off our conversation by saying “I already have a Will, so I think I might be taken care of.” What they mean is that they have an older Will that was drafted and signed years back. Or, in some cases, they have drafted their own Will which may not be effective if not done correctly. They believe that by simply having a Will, they have avoided the need to involve the courts in their estate after their death. That&#8217;s a common myth. If you have to use your Will after you die, you are going through the Court process. If one of your goals is to avoid the need for court intervention in your estate, you should avoid ever having to use the Will. You need to add a Trust in your estate planning.</p>
<p><span id="more-515"></span></p>
<p><strong>What is a Will and What Does It Do?</strong></p>
<p>The Last Will and Testament, commonly referred to simply as a Will, is the document most people associate with estate planning. A Will, however, is the document that accomplishes the fewest of many individuals’ objectives.</p>
<p>After you die, if any of your assets need to go through any Court directed re-titling process, the Will is the document that directs the Court how to behave. This Court directed re-titling process is called probate. If you pass away with any assets in your name individually when you die, the assets remain in a state of limbo as they have no living owner. The probate process allows a Court to nominate someone to take control of these assets and re-title them in the name of your beneficiaries. That person is called your executor or personal representative. The Will is the document that directs the Court who to nominate as your executor, and who the executor needs to give the assets to.</p>
<p>Probate can be a very time consuming and costly process. It generally takes somewhere between 8-12 months to administer a probate estate. During that time your beneficiaries aren’t enjoying the legacy you left to them. It can, in fact, take much longer than that. Probate costs can eat up somewhere between 5-10% of the balance of your estate. This is all money that could have gone to your beneficiaries with better planning. Also, probate is a Court procedure. All of the assets that go through probate become public knowledge as well as the disposition of those assets. This allows anyone to see what assets were in your estate, and who they were left to.</p>
<p><strong>By simply having a Will, you have not avoided probate.</strong> You have only given directions to the Court as to how to act during probate. Wills can have some additional benefits beyond directing the Court how to re-title your assets. One example is nominating guardians for minor and disabled children as well as making administration easier on your executor. You should always have a Will, but it may make sense to consider additional estate planning documents.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Trust and What Does It Do?</strong></p>
<p>A Living Trust, sometimes referred to simply as a Trust, is a document that can help you avoid the need for probate. It provides many additional benefits. The Trust gives you the ability to re-title assets into the name of the Trust. That legally removes those assets from your name individually. The Trust then states how those assets are administered during your life, who is in charge of those assets, and where they go after you die. This avoids the need for those assets to go through probate after your death. This allows your beneficiaries to receive the property they are entitled to much more quickly, and it&#8217;s more cost effective than probate. This also keeps the distribution of your estate confidential.</p>
<p>A Trust provides additional benefits to minor and disabled beneficiaries. If a minor becomes entitled to receive property, the Trust can state that the property can be used for the minor’s benefit, but is not to be distributed to them until they reach a certain age (such as 25 or 30 years old.) It can also state that if someone is disabled and is receiving government benefits, that the property is to remain in the Trust to be used to supplement those government benefits. It can stipulate that funds not be distributed to them outright so as to jeopardize those benefits.</p>
<p>Trusts can also provide asset protection, tax planning, long term care planning, and many other benefits depending on the type of trust used.</p>
<p><strong>Should I have a Will, a Trust, or Both?</strong></p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on your goals, but many times the answer is “both.” A Trust can accomplish probate avoidance objectives, provide protection to minor and disabled beneficiaries, and accomplish asset protection goals and many other objectives. A Will can provide a failsafe. If any assets that should have been in your Trust during your life end up going through probate, the Will can direct the Court to re-title the assets into the Trust, thus maintaining all the protections the Trust was put in place to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Planning Ahead is Critical</strong></p>
<p>In order to be effective, Wills and Living Trusts must be put into place correctly during your lifetime and prior to any disability. Waiting until it is too late can have disastrous consequences. As with other aspects of your estate plan, with proper planning, you can ensure a good quality of life for you and your family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By <a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/attorneys/brian-g-quinn/">Brian G. Quinn</a></em></p>
<p>It’s November 2012. Are you doing your year end planning? Many of my clients are. <strong>Estate taxes</strong> is a topic that keeps coming up time and time again. Did you know that estate taxes are scheduled to go up drastically in 2013?</p>
<p><strong>Will Your Estate Taxes Increase?</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example; If you have a $1.3 million estate today you would not be subject to an estate tax. Proper planning will help you completely avoid estate taxes.  However, if nothing is done by January 1, 2013, your estate could be subject to $165,000 in federal taxes at your death.  How can this tax be avoided?  With tax rates on estates over $1 million set to be taxed at 55% in 2013, there are great gifting and planning opportunities that need to be taken advantage of in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>What Does the Estate Tax Look Like in 2012?</strong></p>
<p>Under current law, the federal estate tax exemption is $5,120,000. That means that anyone who passes away can exempt $5.12 million of property from estate taxes. Any property over that $5.12 million threshold is taxed at 35%.  Current law also allows someone to make gifts during their lifetime of up to $5.12 million in property without being subject to gift taxes.<span id="more-491"></span></p>
<p><strong>What Will Happen With Estate Taxes in 2013?</strong></p>
<p>In some ways we have some direction as to what will happen to estate taxes in 2013 and beyond, but in some ways the answer to this question is very much up in the air.  Without any additional action from Congress and the President, the exemption is scheduled to fall to $1,000,000 with any amounts over $1 million being taxed at 55%. The gift tax exemption is also scheduled to drop from $5.12 million to $1 million.  What the increase in taxes means for someone passing away in 2013 with a $ 5 million estate is that their estate could be subject to $2.2 million in taxes.  That same $5 million estate would incur no taxes in 2012.  That’s a pretty drastic change in tax liabilities.  Luckily, there is planning that can be done for a fraction of this cost today to avoid this situation.</p>
<p><strong>What Can Be Done Now to Avoid Estate Tax Expenses?</strong></p>
<p>Since we have such a high threshold for gifts, clients who want to take advantage of the ability to gift property out of their estate up to $5.12 million gift tax free should do so immediately.  As with any gifting program, consult an estate planning attorney, as well as financial and tax professionals before gifting property to another person.  This will allow someone to give a legacy now to their beneficiaries, while at the same time reducing their estate tax liability in the future.</p>
<p>Another option we have is life insurance to pay estate tax liabilities.  If someone knows they need to plan for a tax liability at their death, it is a good idea to have a life insurance policy that can pay those taxes.  But the problem with simply owning a life insurance policy that will pay out in the event of your death is that the proceeds of that policy could be considered part of your estate if not structured properly.  By creating the right type of trust, such as an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust or ILIT, we can have a policy owned by a trust outside of your estate, with the ability to pay estate taxes for you.  This creates liquidity in the event of an estate tax issue, or additional inheritance for your beneficiaries if the estate tax threshold goes up.</p>
<p><strong>Planning Ahead is Critical</strong></p>
<p>We may not know what the future of the estate tax may hold, but we know what the future is scheduled to hold.  With more taxes on the horizon, the time to plan is now.  By getting together with a team of trusted estate, tax, and financial advisors, you can plan to ensure a good quality of life and legacy for you and your family.  Please contact us today for a free consultation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By <a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/attorneys/brian-g-quinn/">Brian G. Quinn</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Why are Powers of Attorney so important?</strong></p>
<p>You make important choices every day about your lifestyle; how to pay your bills, how to combat illnesses, how to accumulate wealth and how to achieve your retirement goals. The ability to make these everyday decisions are things people take for granted.  But what if you were in a sudden car accident or suffered another debilitating injury that left you unable to make those choices?  What happens when you can’t make decisions regarding your medical treatments due to a mental or physical incapacity?  Who pays the bills and keeps your house out of foreclosure?  A Durable Power of Attorney answers these questions by nominating someone to take care of making important medical decisions on your behalf, and making sure bills and property are taken care of.<span id="more-473"></span></p>
<p><strong>What Does “Durable” Mean?</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not, not all powers of attorney continue to be effective after you become disabled.  Some powers of attorney actually become ineffective after your incapacity.  Missouri law has specific language that must be included in a power of attorney to make it “durable.” That means it remains effective after you become incapacitated.  It is absolutely critical that your power of attorney has language indicating it is “durable.”</p>
<p><strong>Durable Health Care Powers of Attorney</strong></p>
<p>Durable Health Care Powers of Attorney allow someone to step into your shoes during your disability. They can make medical decisions on your behalf when you are unable. This is critical. Your doctors and hospital staff must have someone to speak to, share medical opinions with, and get the authorization to perform potentially lifesaving treatments and surgeries.  A Durable Health Care Power of Attorney may be your most important estate planning document.</p>
<p><strong>Durable Powers of Attorney for Financial and Property Matters</strong></p>
<p>Durable Powers of Attorney for financial and property matters allow someone to step into your shoes during your disability. It gives them access to bank and other financial accounts and safety deposit boxes. It allows them to buy and sell real estate and make sure your bills get paid on time.  Without a Durable Power of Attorney for financial and property matters, you may not have anyone to make mortgage and car loan payments. Those assets could be foreclosed or re-possessed.  Power of attorney documents can also allow someone to do additional estate planning for you.</p>
<p><strong>What Happens If I Don’t Have a Power of Attorney?</strong></p>
<p>Without a power of attorney in place, your spouse or other family members will have to petition the court to have you declared mentally or physically incapacitated. The court will have to appoint a guardian and conservator.  Before someone can be appointed to take care of you and your finances, the court will have a &#8220;guardian ad litem&#8221; appointed.  That&#8217;s an attorney chosen by the court to investigate the matter and make a recommendation as to who is the best choice to take care of you.  This process can take anywhere from 2-3 months or more, depending on the situation.  The attorney representing your spouse or other family member will get paid from your estate, and so will the guardian ad litem.  You can avoid all of this time and cost by appointing a power of attorney prior to your incapacity.</p>
<p><strong>Planning Ahead is Critical</strong></p>
<p>Once you are disabled, it is too late to put a power of attorney in place.  Even if you already have a power of attorney, it is good to have it reviewed every few years in order to ensure it meets your goals.  As with other aspects of your estate plan, with proper planning, you can ensure a good quality of life for you and your family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By <a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/attorneys/brian-g-quinn/">Brian G. Quinn</a></em></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> <strong>buy-sell agreement</strong> could have helped a recent business client avoid a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call my client Max. Max’s business partner owned half the business. The partner died, leaving behind a wife and two adult children.</p>
<p>Max had always gotten along with his partner&#8217;s family. But he never had any business discussions with them.  A few months after the funeral his partner’s wife called asking questions about the business. His partner’s children also called asking questions. They all claimed to be co-owners of the business according to his partner’s estate plan. They either wanted money to buy out their shares or they wanted to make important decisions about the company’s future.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the money to buy their shares in the business” Max said “so, am I really in business with my partner’s family now?” The answer was difficult to take. Without the money on hand to buy out the shares, Max was indeed in business with his partner’s family. Max wasn&#8217;t happy.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two questions. What are Max&#8217;s options now, and how could he have avoided this mess?<span id="more-443"></span></p>
<p><strong>What Is a Buy-Sell Agreement?</strong></p>
<p>One of the most crucial documents for a business owner in business with others is a Buy-Sell Agreement.  A Buy-Sell Agreement is a legally binding agreement that governs what happens when a partner or owner of a business either dies, becomes disabled, is forced to leave the business or chooses to leave the business.</p>
<p>A buy-sell agreement can provide liquidity for dealing with these major events in a business. It also helps to avoid infighting among family members, co-owners, and spouses.</p>
<p>For Max, having a buy-sell agreement could have answered the following questions after his partner died:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is my new co-owner my deceased partner’s wife and kids?</li>
<li>Do I have to buy them out?</li>
<li>If I have to buy them out, what amount do I need to pay them?</li>
<li>If I need to buy them out, where does the money come from?</li>
<li>Can they sell their interests in the business to my competitors if they need money?</li>
<li>Can I start a new business or do I have to stick with the old one?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Does a Buy-Sell Agreement Work?</strong></p>
<p>A buy-sell agreement legally binds the people who sign it, and their heirs as well.  That means that any co-owners wives, children, and other beneficiaries are also bound by the terms of the agreement.  The agreement can also establish a manner of valuing the business for buy-out and purchase purposes, so there are no disputes as to how much money needs to change hands.</p>
<p><strong>How is a Buy-Sell Agreement Funded?</strong></p>
<p>A life insurance policy is generally used to fund a buy-sell agreement.  When someone dies, insurance money flows into the business. The money is used to purchase the business interests from the heirs of the deceased co-owner. It also provides enough money to stay afloat during the transition.  Finally, it ensures that the business interests stay in-house and the original owners can control who they are in business with.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Any Options?</strong></p>
<p>There are many different types of buy-sell agreements. They can address many issues such as disability and retirement, beyond just the death of an owner.  An estate planning and business attorney experienced in drafting buy-sell agreements can help you choose and draft the right type of agreement for you.</p>
<p><strong>Who Needs a Buy-Sell Agreement?</strong></p>
<p>For any business owner in business with others, an updated buy-sell agreement is an absolute must have.  Just like many other legal issues in business, if you prepare in advance, you are better off when something unforeseen happens.  If protection for your business and family is important to you, act now before it is too late.</p>

</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Special Needs Trust is Required When a Simple Inheritance Can Do More Harm Than Good</strong></p>
<p>I recently had a client walk into my office who had just learned he was receiving a large inheritance from his father.  He was extremely worried and upset about this.  My client was disabled, and was receiving Medicaid health care benefits as well as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for food and shelter.  He was concerned he would lose his benefits.  He was right to be worried about this as too much money can cause you to lose these benefits.  He couldn’t find private health insurance because of his disabilities, and he needed his benefits for food and shelter because he couldn’t work.  How could this have been avoided?</p>
<p><strong>A Special Needs Trust Solves the Problem</strong></p>
<p>For those who have a child or  loved ones with mental or physical disabilities, providing that loved one with a certain quality of life while you are alive and after you are gone can be complicated.  It can be especially complicated when your loved one depends on government programs such as Medicaid and SSI to provide their lifetime care.  A Special Needs Trust (sometimes called a Supplemental Needs Trust) is the only legal entity that can protect your loved one&#8217;s government benefits which provide for their lifetime care, and still provide them with the quality of life they deserve.<span id="more-417"></span></p>
<p><strong>Why Do I Need a Special Needs Trust and How Do I Create One?</strong></p>
<p>A Special Needs Trust is a legal entity that protects someone’s ability to receive “means tested” government benefits such as Medicaid and SSI.  A “means tested” government program means that the your eligibility is based on how much money you have.  Medicaid provides health care benefits for those that qualify, whereas SSI provides a small monthly income for food and shelter.</p>
<p>Medicaid and SSI provide lifetime care for a loved one with special needs, but due to the limited benefits offered by each program, they do not provide a good quality of life.  In order to ensure a good quality of life, many family members will want to leave assets that can be used to ensure a comfortable quality of life.  However, especially with Medicaid benefits, it is critically important to ensure a loved one remains qualified for these programs, and an inheritance is likely to disqualify them for benefits.</p>
<p>A Special Needs Trust can ensure that lifetime care from government programs is maintained, and can provide a good quality of life derived from assets left in the trust to be used for a loved one with special needs.  A Special Needs Trust can take on many forms, but it is used to “supplement” needs not provided for by government programs, but protects those benefits by not using the trust proceeds to “supplant” those benefits.  A Special Needs Trust can be established with the help of an attorney who specializes in this type of planning.</p>
<p><strong>How do I Fund a Special Needs Trust?</strong></p>
<p>The Special Needs Trust should be funded when it is created so that your loved one can have their special needs met without compromising government benefits eligibility, and without interruption in case something happens to you.  But how do you fund it, and how much money should it be funded with?</p>
<p>The answer of how much it should be funded with depends on what quality of life you want to leave your loved one.  Also, you should think about not just funding “needs”, but “wants and wishes” as well.</p>
<p>Your Special Needs Trust can be funded with real estate, non-qualified investments such as bank accounts and stocks and bonds, qualified assets such as IRAs and 401(k)s, and life insurance proceeds.  Although real estate can be a good trust investment as it can be sold for cash upon your death, the value of the asset is subject to the market at the time, and it may be tough to sell for a period of time after it goes on the market.  There are risks with leaving non-qualified investments in the trust as well since you never know if you saved enough to cover your loved one&#8217;s lifetime, and their values can fluctuate depending on the market.  Qualified retirement accounts may not be a good asset to leave to a trust either, as taxes are incurred at the time of the distribution to the trust.  For these reasons, many believe life insurance is a must consider option for funding a Special Needs Trust.</p>
<p><strong>How Does a Guardianship Fit In?</strong></p>
<p>When children are minors, their parents are considered their natural and legal guardians.  But what happens if they pass away?  What happens after they turn 18?   A court appointed Guardianship answers these questions.  A Guardianship gives someone else the ability to make decisions for someone’s personal and physical well being.  A parent can petition the court to be appointed a guardian over adult children after they turn 18 years old, and can also appoint someone to be appointed the guardian of their children through their Last Will and Testament.</p>
<p><strong>Planning Ahead is Critical</strong></p>
<p>For anyone with a child or loved one with special needs, planning ahead with solid estate and financial planning is an absolute must.  Not having a plan in place is irresponsible, and can have devastating effects on a special needs child’s future.  Additionally, picking the right estate planning attorney with experience planning for families and individuals with special needs is important.  With proper planning, you can ensure a good quality of life for you and your family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By <a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/attorneys/brian-g-quinn/">Brian G. Quinn</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Can Medicaid take your house?</strong> This is a question that one of my clients recently asked me after receiving a letter from the State Medicaid department.  My client’s father had a stroke several years ago that left him in a nursing home.  He quickly ran through his assets, and applied for Medicaid.  When they applied, the family informed Medicaid that their father still owned his house, and they were assured the home would not be counted as an asset for qualification purposes.</p>
<p><strong>The Medicaid Story Gets Tricky</strong></p>
<p>Her father was approved for benefits and Medicaid paid for his nursing home until his death.  After he died, however, the family discovered that the Medicaid department planned on placing a lien on the family home for the benefits they had paid out.</p>
<p><span id="more-373"></span></p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the Rule</strong></p>
<p>When someone makes an application for Medicaid benefits, the Medicaid department will look at all of that individual’s assets to see if they have too much money to qualify.  As a general rule, a person’s home is exempt from this asset calculation as long as the equity value is under a certain amount, or if you are married and your spouse lives in the home.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s Where it Changes</strong></p>
<p>Although the house may be exempt at the time you apply for Medicaid, current law requires Medicaid to go after the equity in the home after you die as reimbursement for the benefits paid out during life.  The Medicaid department can even come after a partial interest in a home owned jointly with another person.  If you transfer the house out of your name to try and avoid Medicaid liens, you may jeopardize your ability to ever receive Medicaid benefits.  If assets (including the home) are transferred within the five years leading up to a Medicaid application, the Medicaid department can institute a “penalty period” on an individual for making those gifts.  If a penalty period is imposed, the individual under the penalty will not receive Medicaid until that penalty period has run out.  This can cost a family hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Planning Ahead is the Solution</strong></p>
<p>Is there anything that we can do to protect the family home? There are several options available to individuals looking to protect the family home.  Medicaid has several safe harbor provisions that allow someone to transfer the family home to a spouse, child caregiver, or disabled child without penalty.  For those with the foresight to plan ahead, Irrevocable Asset Protection Trusts may be used to defeat Medicaid liens and save the family home.</p>
<p><strong>Get the Help You Need</strong></p>
<p>Remember that Medicaid rules are complicated and can change quickly.  Individual circumstances will differ.  For these reasons it is always important to consult a knowledgeable elder law attorney when formulating a plan to protect your assets.Next time someone asks, &#8220;Can Medicaid take your house?&#8221;  you can now answer, &#8220;Not if you get help with proper planning.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Clients sometimes ask, &#8220;Will Medicare cover nursing home expenses?&#8221;  Here are three surprising facts you can&#8217;t ignore.</strong></p>
<p>On its website, the Medicare program talks about the number of people who will eventually need nursing home care.  They provide the following information.</p>
<p>Are you sitting down?</p>
<p>1)      By 2020, 12 million older Americans will need long term care.</p>
<p>2)      People who reach the age of 65 will likely have a 40 percent chance of entering a nursing home.</p>
<p>3)      About 10 percent of the people who enter a nursing home will stay there five years or more.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for nursing home care to cost $6,500.00 a month or more.  <strong>Privately paying for a nursing home can often cost seniors in excess of $75,000.00 per year.</strong>  Given this cost, long term care can quickly take a devastating toll on a family’s budget.  These costs can completely drain someone’s life savings.  Most people are generally familiar with the Medicare program and that it pays for certain health care costs for people 65 years old or older.  But will Medicare pay for long term care?<span id="more-336"></span></p>
<p><strong>Medicare’s coverage for nursing home care is very limited and often doesn’t pay for long term care. </strong> Even if it does pay, it only covers up to 100 days of skilled nursing care per illness.  Frequently, if certain requirements are not met, Medicare’s coverage of skilled nursing care will cease prior to the 100-day maximum.</p>
<p>The coverage Medicare provides is for acute, short-term medical care and rehabilitative services.  These services are typically referred to as “skilled nursing care.”  When most people think of nursing home care, they are thinking of “custodial care.”  Some examples of custodial care include assistance with bathing, dressing, transferring from the bed to a chair and toileting.</p>
<p>The Medicare program on its website, Medicare.gov, explains the limitations of its coverage for custodial long term care:</p>
<p>“Generally, Medicare doesn’t pay for long-term care.  Medicare pays only for medically necessary skilled nursing facility or home health care.  However, you must meet certain conditions for Medicare to pay for these types of care.  Most long-term care is to assist people with support services such as activities of daily living like dressing, bathing and using the bathroom.  Medicare doesn’t pay for this type of care called “custodial care.”  Custodial care (non-skilled care) is care that helps you with activities of daily living.  It may also include care that most people do for themselves, for example, diabetes monitoring.  Some Medicare Advantage Plans (formerly Medicare + Choice) may offer limited skilled nursing facility and home care (skilled care) coverage if the care is medically necessary.  You may have to pay some of the costs.”</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s</strong><strong> clear that people must look to a source other than Medicare to pay the substantial cost of custodial care in a nursing home.</strong>  The good news is that there are solutions that can preserve and protect your assets from the potentially devastating costs of long term care.</p>
<p><strong>A knowledgeable elder law attorney can recommend legal and financial strategies to keep you from losing your life savings in a nursing home.</strong>  Since each person’s situation and goals are different, each person’s solution must be customized to meet their own individual needs.  Generally, the earlier you start, the more options you will have available to you.</p>
<p><strong>Contact us today and we will be happy to assist you in achieving your goals with the best plan for your circumstances.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Think Estate Planning for Young Couples can be ignored? Guess again.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m an estate planning attorney in my thirties. Many of my friends and family are getting married and having children. They often ignore the subject of estate planning, thinking that &#8220;Estate planning for young couples simply isn&#8217;t necessary.&#8221;  That&#8217;s a big mistake.</p>
<p>Estate planning isn&#8217;t just about asset protection. It&#8217;s also about making sure that you get to decide what happens with your health, your family, and even your pets.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a twist that will surprise you</strong></p>
<p>You might assume that spouses automatically become joint owners of each others&#8217; property. That is not the case in Missouri or Illinois, the states where I practice.<span id="more-213"></span></p>
<p>Failure to plan your estate, even at a young age, is irresponsible. That sounds harsh, but estate planning for young couples is vital. Here are some of the things that can happen if you have no estate plan:<br />
&#8211;    Spouses may be unintentionally disinherited.<br />
&#8211;    Children may be left with no one to take care of them.<br />
&#8211;    Long court battles may ensue before being able to access assets for maintenance and support or before being able to re-title the family home in their names.<br />
&#8211;    Ugly fights between family members may break out over your health care.<br />
&#8211;    There may be no one to take care of your pets.</p>
<h3><strong>Take these vital estate planning steps to avoid terrible consequences.</strong></h3>
<p>Depending on your situation you should do some or all of the following:</p>
<p><strong>Change Beneficiary Designations</strong></p>
<p>Many of us may have our parents or siblings as our beneficiaries on life insurance policies, bank accounts and retirement accounts prior to our marriage.  If we pass away without changing these designations, we have disinherited our spouse.  If we have children, we may have disinherited them as well.</p>
<p>Contact your financial planner and financial institution. Make sure that your spouse and children are beneficiaries of your assets upon your death. Establish a trust to provide for your spouse and children. It&#8217;s sometimes more beneficial to leave property directly to your trust upon death, depending on the type of asset.</p>
<p><strong>Re-title Real Estate and Financial Accounts</strong></p>
<p>If either spouse owns real estate and financial accounts prior to their marriage, they likely have it titled in their name alone.  When they marry, they may not think to have it re-titled in their spouses name as joint owners, or to record a transfer on death designation or deed.  Taking that step would re-title the property into the spouse’s name in the event of death.  If they have children, they may want their children to have the use of that property in the event of death.</p>
<p><strong>Where does that property go if they die?</strong> Here&#8217;s what happens in Missouri and Illinois.</p>
<p>Property titled in one person’s name alone when they pass away means that the property must first pass through the probate process before being re-titled into someone else’s name.  The probate process generally takes between seven to nine months for an easy estate, and can take more than a year for complicated or contested estates.  During this time, your spouse and children do not have the full use the assets or ability to mortgage, sell, rent, or do anything else with the real estate.  If accounts and real estate is either re-titled into joint names or steps are taken to ensure that it passes to the spouse or children upon your death, this probate process can be avoided.  If steps are taken to re-title the assets or real estate into a trust during your lifetime, this probate process can be avoided as well, plus the trust can provide additional benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Create Powers of Attorney and Living Wills</strong></p>
<p>Terri Schiavo of Florida was twenty-six years old when she slipped into a coma, setting the stage for a fifteen year fight between her husband and parents over her ultimate care wishes.  Those fifteen years of heartache and publicity for her and her family could have been avoided by planning for a possible incapacity by having powers of attorney and a living will.<br />
Powers of Attorney documents can take care of health care, financial and property matters and allow someone to step into your shoes and manage your affairs should you become incapacitated.  A Health Care Power of Attorney allows someone to coordinate your health care when you can’t, ensuring doctors and hospitals can coordinate your treatment without fear of malpractice claims.  A Durable Power of Attorney for financial and property matters allow someone to access your bank accounts to make your house payment, car payment, and take care of your spouse and dependents.  A Living Will expresses your final wishes pertaining to life sustaining treatment options.</p>
<p><strong>Establish Guardianships for Children</strong></p>
<p>If you pass away with children, who takes care of them?  Without planning, the answer to that question is up to the court.  Will the court pick the same person you would have?  Will the court pick a family member?  Will your child end up in the custody of the state?</p>
<p>No parent wants to risk not knowing the answer to these questions.  You can take the answers out of the court’s determination by appointing a guardian for the person and conservator for the estate of your children through a validly executed will.  It may also be a good idea to consider a trust for your children’s benefit.</p>
<p>Consider Trusts for Assets and Life Insurance Proceeds (Especially with Minor Children)</p>
<p>Many young couples with children have started accumulating assets for retirement, and before those assets are accumulated have taken out large life insurance policies to make sure that their spouse and children are taken care of in the case of an untimely death.  But if your spouse isn’t around to receive the assets upon your death, they may need to go through the probate process and be tied up in court for many months.  Worse yet, who manages them for your children once the court is finished?</p>
<p>A court will not allow a minor child to manage their own financial affairs, and will appoint a conservator to manage their assets in the event they are entitled to proceeds after a death.  This puts the estate under court supervision, and makes assets less available to your children than you intended.  The best way to ensure that the assets are managed efficiently and effectively for years to come, and are available for your children’s health, education, maintenance and support needs quickly and without court interference, is to create a trust for assets and the proceeds of life insurance to flow into after your death.</p>
<p><strong>Consider Estate Planning for Your Pets</strong></p>
<p>Many young couples with and without children may have pets that are like children themselves.  Who takes care of these pets after they die or become incapacitated?  Where will they live?  What money will be used to take care of their food, medical and other needs?  Pets are treated as personal property, and provisions must be made for their care if they are not to be destroyed upon your passing.  Just like trusts for children, trusts for pets can be established for their care.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Estate planning for newlyweds and young couples is not a luxury, it&#8217;s a practical necessity. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of putting it off. Get started now, so you can rest easy and truly enjoy your life together.</p>

<p><strong>Creditors, predators and lawsuits – OH MY!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have the kind of protection that gives you peace of mind?</strong></p>
<p>Over the last two decades, asset protection planning has become a crucial aspect of most estate planning. <strong>The creative use of irrevocable trusts can be one of the most powerful tools in estate planning and asset protection plans.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Missouri Asset Protection Trusts provide the state&#8217;s residents with some great options, not offered in all other states.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-179"></span></p>
<p><strong>Asset protection for the average Joe</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make the mistake of assuming that asset protection planning is only for high net worth individuals. Even &#8220;average net worth&#8221; people can benefit from a discussion with their estate planning attorney. It is true, however, that asset protection planning should be a higher priority for individuals whose jobs subject them to more creditor claims. Examples are doctors, lawyers, real estate investors, and small business owners.</p>
<p><strong>What makes Missouri different?</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the general rule in most states; If the individual creating the trust is a beneficiary of that trust, then the creditor can reach the maximum amount of property to which that individual is entitled. Many classic Revocable Living Trusts provide that an individual is entitled to all distributions of income and principal, and hence provide no asset protection. In case you missed it, that&#8217;s a bad thing. Missouri, however, is one of a handful of states that have altered the normal rule to allow expanded asset protection planning for individuals when using an special type of irrevocable trust.</p>
<p>A Missouri Asset Protection Trust is an irrevocable trust that allows an individual to transfer their assets into the trust, retain the ability to be a beneficiary of the trust and also retain certain powers and controls over the trust. They also have protection from future creditors and bankruptcies.</p>
<p><strong>Which option is right for you?</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the classic Missouri Asset Protection Trust described above, there are several other irrevocable trust options which may make sense depending on the individual’s goals, their need for control over the trust, and type of property being held in the trust. Some of these options allow the individual to retain complete control over the property in the trust. Other options give the majority of the control to others (generally family members). Have a thorough discussion with a qualified asset protection attorney, reviewing all of the options available to you and cover all your bases.</p>
<p><strong>Special family considerations</strong></p>
<p>If you want asset protection for your family members and future generations, consider the creation of a trust that provides specific protection for those individuals. If a family member has special needs that will require maintaining government benefits throughout his or her life, then a special needs trust will be an important option to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Spendthrift provisions</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to include a “spendthrift provision.&#8221; A spendthrift provision restricts a family member from using the assets to which he or she is entitled for satisfying creditor claims, either voluntarily or involuntarily. If drafted correctly, the trust can provide protection from many other unforeseen events, such as future bankruptcy and divorce.</p>
<p><strong>Special needs trusts</strong></p>
<p>A special needs trust is a type of trust that maintains an individual’s eligibility for certain government programs, such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These trust must be carefully drafted so as to withstand the scrutiny of these government entities. It is important to ensure that these trust only “supplement” and not “supplant” those benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Planning ahead is crucial</strong></p>
<p>Asset protection strategies such as those outlined above require planning before creditor issues arise. Missouri law allows creditors to satisfy claims from assets that are transferred to an asset protection vehicle while known claims are pending. If protection from creditors, predators, lawsuits and bankruptcy is important to you, act now before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
