				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/28152105_s.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-902" src="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/28152105_s-240x300.jpg" alt="Injured on the Job?" width="240" height="300" /></a> Are you covered at your workplace by Workers’ Compensation Insurance? Most employees are, with a few exceptions. You can easily find out by looking for or asking about a Workers’ Comp posting, often placed on the bulletin board in the employee lunchroom, or another common area where workers gather. This post will also explain what you should do if you are injured on the job in Missouri, and which doctors or healthcare facilities have been approved to treat you following your injury. <em>What Workers’ Comp Covers</em> Workers’ Comp covers most injuries and illnesses caused by work, from cuts and falls to muscle strains and repetitive motion injuries. Exposure to hazardous substances are covered and pre-existing conditions aggravated by your work duties may also be covered. It might sound like Workers’ Compensation Insurance is in place to protect you when you are injured on the job in Missouri, and it does. But you might be surprised to know that, initially, lawmakers instituted Workers’ Comp to protect companies from lawsuits brought by injured workers. So it makes sense to know your rights, in the event that a work injury should happen to you. You don’t want to miss out on benefits because you miss required deadlines or because filing a claim is too complex. For example, if you don’t file your claim because you fear retaliation from your employer, but your injury makes it hard to continue doing your job and you are eventually fired, you would have missed the deadline for filing, and you may also find it difficult to find a new job, given your injury. Workers’ Comp laws vary from state to state. If you are injured on the job in Missouri, you are required to promptly notify your employer. The employer has the right to select the doctor who will treat your injury, and this information should be easily visible on the posted notice. If you are not sure, ask your employer, because visiting the doctor of your own choice may mean your employer is not liable to pay the medical bills for your treatment. In most cases, you will receive some compensation for time missed from work. Depending on the extent of your injuries, you may be entitled to temporary or permanent disability payments. <em>What if Your Boss Says You’re Not Covered?</em> If your supervisor insists your injury isn’t covered, consider calling a knowledgeable workers’ comp attorney. Generally speaking, workers’ compensation lawyers take on only those cases that can be won. Attorneys are paid a percentage of the monetary award, so you don’t need to pay any fees upfront. In Missouri, employment is “at-will” – generally, you can’t sue just for being fired, but you may be able to sue if your employer fails to maintain Workers’ Comp insurance, and you can possibly sue the manufacturer of equipment involved in your accident or injury. As well, illegal reasons exist for firing at-will employees, in which case you may have a wrongful termination case. Your attorney is trained to untangle these complexities, so be sure to share all the facts. The knowledgeable workers’ comp attorneys at Quinn &amp; Banton are happy to assist in protecting your rights and winning the compensation you deserve under the law.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With each new year, we make promises to do things better, to be healthier, to work less and enjoy life more…all worthwhile goals. This year, though, why not take steps to protect your financial future too?</p>
<p>Having a will is smart, as is setting up a trust for future generations, because both protect your assets upon your death. But another document can protect you in life – a Healthcare Power of Attorney – and talking with a knowledgeable lawyer about it may prevent stressful and expensive court proceedings if an accident or injury incapacitates you.</p>
<p>A Healthcare Power of Attorney is a “legal form that allows an individual to empower another with decisions regarding his or her healthcare and medical treatment. Healthcare power of attorney becomes active when a person is unable to make decisions or consciously communicate intentions regarding treatments.” (Investopedia)</p>
<p><em>Durable Power of Attorney in Missouri<a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/14415752_s.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-908" src="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/14415752_s-300x300.jpg" alt="Peace of Mind with Proper Legal Advice" width="300" height="300" /></a></em></p>
<p>In Missouri, a Power of Attorney allows you to appoint someone to care for your personal business if you are hospitalized or homebound. The Durable Power of Attorney is similar, but takes effect if you should become incapacitated, allowing the individual you have designated (your “agent”) to take over your affairs when you most need help &#8211; for example, in making decisions about home health care, nursing care, or long-term care.  The addition of the word “durable” means that the Power of Attorney cannot be terminated because you are incapacitated; however, because you have not passed away, your agent cannot make a will on your behalf, or revoke a will you have made, which is a protection to you. Generally, the agent is most often a friend or a family member, and not required to be a resident of Missouri. However, the individual must be over 18, of sound mind and body, not a health care provider or connected to the facility caring for you, and not a judge or a clerk of the court. If you should pass away, both The Power of Attorney and Durable Power of Attorney are automatically terminated.</p>
<p><em>A Powerful Estate Planning Tool </em></p>
<p>The Durable Power of Attorney is a powerful estate planning tool demanding your careful consideration. Always seek professional legal advice from a knowledgeable estate planning attorney when preparing this and related documents to minimize the potential for exploitation of your finances.  In particular, your attorney knows how to create the proper language to ensure that all transactions are to your benefit, your money is used only for your care, your designated agent cannot gift himself or others, and a mandatory accounting of all transactions and review by a trusted accountant is carried out. In Missouri, estate planning attorneys are ready to help at Quinn &amp; Banton.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Umbrella.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-896" src="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Umbrella-300x250.jpg" alt="Umbrella Policy" width="300" height="250" /></a>When regular liability insurance just isn’t enough to cover your responsibility for damages related to an accident or incident, excess liability coverage &#8211; the so-called “umbrella policy” &#8211; can help to protect you from major claims and lawsuits by providing liability coverage beyond the limits of your homeowners or auto policies.</p>
<p>Generally, umbrella policies are available in increments from $1 to $5 million, available after you’ve met your insurance company’s primary liability limits. Some umbrella policies also cover lost wages and attorney costs, and will protect you even if you travel out of the country.</p>
<p><strong>Why Regular Liability Insurance Isn’t Always Enough</strong></p>
<p>As you earn more and acquire assets, your risk increases, along with your need for greater protection. Liability insurance specifically provides coverage when you or a family member are responsible for someone else’s personal or property damage. Most homeowner’s insurance policies provide a minimum $100,000 in liability coverage, and auto insurance policies provide $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident, although this varies by state. While you can purchase higher limits, these are capped at $500,000. In a litigious world, it simply may not be enough.</p>
<p>Imagine your neighbor trips over your puppy and breaks his hip. Your homeowner’s policy would cover the first $100,000 in property damages and personal injury, but what happens when you are sued for costs beyond this amount? Keep in mind that “property damage” is defined as accidental damage to the property of others caused by you (your family member, your pet, etc.), whereas “personal injury” defines many scenarios, from bodily injury, shock, and emotional or mental distress, to sickness, disease, or death, and even extends to such predicaments as false arrest, detention or imprisonment, malicious prosecution, wrongful entry or eviction, humiliation, libel or slander, defamation of character or invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>This is where the umbrella policy comes into play, increasing your personal liability limits and adding other protections usually not covered in the typical homeowner’s policy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection for covered claims others may make for personal injury or property damage caused by you, a household member, a pet or other hazards on your property</li>
<li>Personal liability coverage – whether damage or injury  occurs on or off your premises</li>
<li>Extra protection against auto-related liabilities, above your primary auto policy</li>
<li>Protection against non-business related personal injury liabilities &#8211;  slander, libel, wrongful eviction, false arrest</li>
<li>Legal defense costs for a covered loss, including lawyer fees and associated court costs</li>
<li>Worldwide coverage- (exception: situations involving foreign ownership of dwellings or cars)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Much Coverage Do You Need?</strong></p>
<p>The answer to this question varies. Factors for consideration include the value of current assets you wish to protect, the value of future assets, your lifestyle risks, the ages of your children (specifically, whether they are driving) and other items.</p>
<p>Considering buying excess liability insurance in Missouri? Get sound advice from a source you can trust: Quinn &amp; Banton.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5025039_s.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-893" src="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5025039_s-200x300.jpg" alt="Mechanics Lien on Your Home" width="200" height="300" /></a>A mechanic&#8217;s lien is a claim made for payment against a homeowner’s property by a contractor who performed construction work on the property. Essentially, the contractor, known as the lien claimant, is stating the property was improved and, therefore, payment must be made.</p>
<p>In Missouri, mechanic’s liens can be used by individual contractors, construction companies, subcontractors, materials and equipment suppliers, laborers, engineers, registered architects, and landscapers. Missouri’s interpretation of mechanics lien law is quite broad, making the inclusion of landscapers unique to the state.</p>
<p>A document known as “Intent to Lien” is required to be filed within ten days prior to filing of a mechanics lien. Other preliminary notices may be required by Missouri law, depending on the type of project and contractor. For example, a general Contractor must provide notice prior to receiving any payment from the property owner. If the property owner has filed a notice of intended sale, the contractor must file the Intent to Lien five days prior to any property transfer. Various other laws apply. Finally, mechanics liens must be notarized. Failure to provide the proper notices ensures your claim will fail.</p>
<p><strong>Six Months to File…or Forget It</strong></p>
<p>In Missouri, it is crucial that the contractor file a mechanics lien within six months following the last day of the provision of services or materials. Filing should take place at the Recorder of Deeds in the county serving the property’s location. One exception: an equipment leasing company must file within sixty days from the date of removal from the property of the last piece of equipment.</p>
<p>Certainly, the lien must include a legal description that attempts to describe the property as thoroughly as possible, although it is generally acknowledged that this description need not be to the letter, but sufficient to positively identify the property. In matters such as these, the guidance of an experienced Missouri business attorney can make all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Recouping Fees Associated with Filing a Mechanics Lien</strong></p>
<p>While Missouri courts generally do award fees to the successful lien claimant, fees (i.e., interest, attorney’s fees or damages) cannot be included in the mechanics lien claim. The lien claimant may only request payment for unpaid labor, material, and/or equipment, and routine profit and overhead. Additionally, the lien claimant must provide a “just and true” accounting of all monies due. General contractors can ask for a lump sum; subcontractors must itemize.</p>
<p>Will your Mechanics Lien ensure you get paid for a project? Here too, laws apply. While all who provided services, material or equipment on the project have equal lien rights, any liens related to mortgages or pre-existing loans take priority. However, if no liens were filed on the property prior to the start of the project, (“pre-existing encumbrances”) the lien claimant takes priority. As well, Missouri courts have instituted an &#8220;implied waiver&#8221; doctrine that gives mechanic&#8217;s lien priority over construction loans, even when the mortgage or deed of trust is filed prior to construction beginning.</p>

That is, as long as there is plenty of money in the bank to provide for a surviving spouse and see the children through to adulthood should a parent’s life end unexpectedly. Do you know of any young families like this? Probably not. Most have mortgages and car loans and schooling costs&#8230;and many struggle financially just to make ends meet. In fact, many young parents make the mistake of believing estate planning is only for older people, or they may assume “We’re young, we’re healthy…nothing is going to happen to us.” Sadly, life is tenuous. Life insurance can be a financial safety net, ensuring funds are available to cover a mortgage, loans, college expenses, medical bills and more. <strong>Which Insurance Type is Best for You?</strong> Two main types of life insurance exist: Term insurance and permanent (whole life) insurance. Term insurance requires a monthly premium for as long as you maintain the insurance. When you die, the value of the life insurance policy is paid to your beneficiary (usually a spouse or children). With whole life, you also pay a monthly premium, but a portion of that payment is invested in a fund which you can access, tax-free, during your lifetime, somewhat like a savings account. This benefit makes whole life insurance premiums higher than term life premiums. Generally speaking, buying insurance when you are young and healthy means premiums will be lower, as compared to someone older with health problems. <strong>Answer These 4 Questions When Selecting Life Insurance</strong> Let’s break down how much money your dependents may need if you die.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your total debt?</li>
</ol>
<p>Buy enough insurance to pay all of your debts in full upon your death. Car loans, credit cards, the mortgage…all of it. Don’t forget to estimate any interest due when bills are paid off.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What is your total income?</li>
</ol>
<p>Buy enough insurance to replace your income. If you earn $75,000 per year and are the family’s sole provider, you’ll want your insurance policy to cover your lost income, plus some extra as an inflationary hedge. Your family should invest the proceeds. If this is not possible, work with an estate planning attorney to help you calculate how much life insurance you really need.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What are your future obligations?</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you hope your children can attend college, or your spouse can take that trip of a lifetime? Then you will need to estimate the costs of these items and cover them via your life insurance policy.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Who else needs insurance?</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no need to insure someone whose death would not impact you financially…say, a young child.  But the death of your spouse may be financially devastating and, in this case, your spouse may also need coverage.  As well, if you have business partners or share financial responsibilities with someone not your spouse, additional coverage may be needed. Determining the necessary amount of life insurance is only the first step in purchasing the best policy for your needs. The offerings are vast, and the information often confusing. You can benefit from consulting with an estate planning attorney. In St Louis, Missouri, call Quinn &amp; Banton.</p>

<p><a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/27593571_s.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-881" src="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/27593571_s-300x200.jpg" alt="Business Dispute" width="300" height="200" /></a>When people argue, communications break down. And when this happens, people sometimes decide to sue. By the time a dispute reaches the courtroom, reaching a resolution may have become all but impossible.</p>
<p>To avoid such a scenario, the courts have instituted an alternative which is growing in use. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is a group of processes aimed at helping people resolve business and personal disputes without having to go to court. Employers, employees, married individuals, and disabled persons are just a few types of people who may choose ADR rather than a costly, expensive and slow trial as a means of dispute resolution.  ADR has proven successful in personal injury cases, products liability cases, routine diversity cases, employment cases, and others. In fact, in St. Louis, Missouri, about 93% of all civil cases are resolved without trial.  (<a href="http://www.moep.uscourts.gov">http://www.moep.uscourts.gov</a> Fact Sheet)</p>
<p><strong>Why Might ADR Be A Better Choice?</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, ADR offers a less formal and less stressful method of dispute resolution, centering on proven tactics of mediation, arbitration, neutral evaluation and collaborative law, while eliminating the costs of a full-blown court case and ensuring a speedier settlement. Rather than “leaving it to the lawyers”, all parties must commit to being actively involved in resolving their issues, which can and does lead to solutions which are both creative and satisfying. And, rather than adding yet another layer to a complex process, the St. Louis ADR program is “built into the Court’s Differentiated Case Management System, designed to work in conjunction with the Court’s case management plan”, so that no additional complexities are added to the case.</p>
<p><strong>Can My Attorney Stay Involved?</strong></p>
<p>Because of the ever-growing case burden on U.S. courts, ADR has become a more common practice when people or entities attempt to resolve disputes prior to a trial. The Arbitrator, a neutral person trained to hear arguments and evidence from each side, decides the outcome.  The arbitrator’s decision is final in cases of binding arbitration; in non-binding arbitration, parties may choose to go to trial if the arbitrator’s decision is not satisfactory. Attorneys are willing to work with and support their clients to resolve disputes through arbitration. The attorney can help the client to select a ‘neutral’ mediator or can serve as mediator in marital dissolution, custody complaints, changes to court orders, and other cases. Attorney mediators can also work with businesses when the process is mandated by the court to avoid protracted litigation.</p>
<p>At Quinn &amp; Banton, our experience has proven ADR to be an affordable, flexible and successful dispute resolution process that saves you time, money, and angst. Call us today to learn more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6177098_s.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-870" src="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6177098_s-300x200.jpg" alt="6177098_s" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Love surely is grand, and the decision to marry is more often fueled by passion rather than logic. Who wants to think about legal documents when there is a ring to buy, caterers to interview, and pictures to be taken?</p>
<p>The fact is that marriage is a legally binding agreement and, as such, individuals who wish to marry must consider the ramifications.</p>
<p>The necessary legal steps, however, do not have to unfeather the love nest. Consider these steps.</p>
<p><strong><em>Before the Wedding…</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li> Apply for your marriage license. The state of Missouri will not recognize your marriage as legally binding unless and until you obtain a marriage license. Certain rules apply for <a href="http://www.stlouiscityrecorder.org/marriage/newmarriage.html">obtaining a marriage license in Missouri</a> – for example, you and your intended must be over 18, must provide proof of identity, and cannot be related.</li>
<li>Decide if your soon-to-be spouse wishes to assume your last name. While this is not required by law, an official copy of the marriage certificate will be required when requesting a name change with government agencies, financial institutions, and other entities</li>
<li>Consider the prenup. A ‘prenup’ (prenuptial agreement) can prevent costly litigation in the event of a future divorce, and can aid in establishing custody of children brought into the marriage from previous relationships.</li>
<li>Talk about money. Before marriage, people tend to gloss over money issues. But money arguments consistently land in the Top 5 Marriage Arguments, so do talk about your debts and your assets, as well as your spending habits. Missouri is a &#8220;dual-property&#8221; state, mean both “marital property” and “non-marital property” exist. It is important to know which items are yours, his or jointly owned.</li>
<li>Make sure your marriage is legal. In Missouri, any clergyman in good standing (active or retired) and any judge can perform your wedding ceremony.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>After the Nuptials</em></strong></p>
<p>Your legal responsibilities do not end with wedded bliss.  Employers, banks, government institutions and others will want proof of your marriage. After you sign your marriage license, your wedding officiant will mail your license to the appropriate county authorities. Once processed, you will complete a form, provide some identification and pay a nominal fee to request copies of your marriage license. Get plenty of official copies, because you will need them to change your name with social security and on your passport and financial accounts, to get a new driver’s license, to update insurance companies and health care providers, to open a joint bank account, and much more.</p>
<p>Compared to marriages of fifty years ago, many more Americans are waiting until their thirties to tie the knot. And while this may signal good news for skyrocketing US divorce rates, couples contemplating marriage still tend to procrastinate about legal aspects of marriage. Take steps toward your happily-ever-after by consulting with a qualified attorney in Missouri today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you operate a business, you probably interact with customers, employees, vendors, lenders and perhaps even landlords. These relationships affect almost all business owners. And when it comes to relationships, each party has their own set of expectations.</p>
<p>This is where a business contract can make a real difference. What are your employees or vendors expecting of you? What can you expect from your landlord or lender? The business contract describes and defines these expectations, clearly outlining terms and conditions, as well as the consequences when things go wrong.</p>
<p>When all parties know and understand their rights and responsibilities, disputes occur less often. If a dispute should arise, the contract provides a solid framework for resolution.</p>
<p>In creating any contract that promises payment for services rendered, an important first step is determining that the owner (the business owner or the property owner) has the ability to pay. “Owner ability to pay” clauses can provide contractors and subcontractors with the authority to obtain the owner’s financing information in order to make an ability-to-pay determination.</p>
<p><strong>Professional firm con<a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/9400252_s.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-865" src="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/9400252_s-300x163.jpg" alt="9400252_s" width="300" height="163" /></a>tracts</strong> often include an attorney’s fees clause, also known as a prevailing party clause. This is a contractual provision ensuring that the plaintiff in a legal case is obligated to pay the defendant’s legal costs in the event the plaintiff loses the case. In other words, the clause attempts to prevent meritless claims. Most claim settlements include a fees and costs waiver, so the provision may never come into play. However, if you are the one on the receiving end of monies due, you will appreciate the bargaining strength such a clause can provide.</p>
<p>How might this clause be written? Here is one typical example:</p>
<p><em>“In the event of any litigation arising from or related to this Agreement, or the services provided under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all reasonable costs incurred including staff time, court costs, attorney’s fees, and all other related expenses incurred in such litigation.”*</em></p>
<p><strong>A Mechanic’s Lien</strong> is another type of contractual tool used by owners and subcontractors.  A subcontractor working for a general contractor who files bankruptcy can file a Mechanic’s Lien to ensure payment for a project.</p>
<p>In our economically challenged times, the Mechanic’s Lien reduces risk for the subcontractor, who can file the claim for unpaid bills against real property he or she has improved with labor or materials. In a bankruptcy scenario, the Mechanic’s Lien also allows the subcontractor to enforce lien rights against a non-debtor third party (most often, the owner of the improved property).</p>
<p>Mechanic’s lien laws are complex, so do not hesitate to seek the services of a qualified business attorney to ensure your rights are protected.</p>
<p>Need assistance negotiating, drafting or reviewing business contracts in Missouri? Please contact the attorneys at Quinn &amp; Banton, LLP.</p>
<p><em>*Always consult an attorney on these matters. This is only an example.</em></p>

<p>When Linda (not her real name) arrives at the nursing home for her weekly visit with her mother, she is surprised to find her sleeping. In the middle of the day? Rousing Mom, Linda helps her walk from the bed to the chair, taking notice of her frailty.</p>
<p>“Mom, have you been eating?”, Linda asks.</p>
<p>Refusing to look directly at Linda, Mom simply shakes her head. But Linda is undeterred.</p>
<p>“Mom, what is wrong? <em>Talk to me</em>!” Still, no response.</p>
<p>Panicking, Linda embraces her mother and feels her pull away slightly, her face wincing. “<em>What</em> is going on?” she wonders fearfully.</p>
<p>Linda soon discovered her mother was suffering from both physical and mental abuse, a scenario that affects millions of America’s elderly citizens.</p>
<p>Elder abuse occurs when an elderly person is neglected, deliberately harmed, or placed in harm&#8217;s way.  You might assume that abuse occurs most often at the hands of strangers. But the majority of cases involve sub-par care provided by a family member, and many of these cases are unreported. Sadly, the elderly are more vulnerable to unprincipled individuals wanting to take advantage of the mentally and physically frail. As well, some caregivers are simply ill-equipped to manage the proper care of an elderly person.</p>
<p><strong>5 Common Signs of Possible Elder Abuse </strong></p>
<p>The case of Linda’s mother was confusing and it took some time for Linda, working with nursing home staff, to get all of the facts. Had she fallen? Was she hurting herself? Or was it abuse? And if it was abuse, who was responsible?</p>
<p>Many cases like this one require time and investigation; some may even require help from a knowledgeable elder law attorney.</p>
<p>Knowing the <strong>common signs of abuse</strong> can help:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>An extreme change in finances:</em> the caregiver may be stealing, or the elder may be bullied into giving money away, changing power of attorney or rewriting the will.</li>
<li><em>Depression or withdrawal:</em> A loss of independence can trigger depression. Dementia may also lead to anger and depression because the elder feels confused about changes.</li>
<li><em>Conflicting stories:</em> The elder may report circumstances – threats, for example &#8211; while the caregiver may tell a different story or refer to the elder in a derogatory way “(She’s just crazy.”)</li>
<li><em>Communication difficulties:</em> While caregiving is certainly stressful, a caregiver’s unusual defensiveness or a complete unwillingness to discuss the elder’s needs may signal trouble.</li>
<li><em>Unexplained injuries:</em> Abused elders often feel ashamed, worthless or stupid. If the elder is mentally incapacitated, awareness of the abuse is diminished. If frequent, unexplained injuries or signs of sexual abuse appear, investigate immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is it Normal, or Is It Abuse?</strong></p>
<p>To avoid talking about or admitting to possible abuse, the elderly person may stop communicating about daily activities, or may no longer participate in once-enjoyable activities. Abuse can sometimes cause repetitive behaviors, (rocking, teeth sucking), which can be misinterpreted as “normal” increasing dementia.</p>
<p>As well, abuse is not always obvious. Forcing a senior to watch sexual videos or look at sexual images, denying medications or over-medicating, placing the senior in restraints, or emotionally berating the elderly person are all forms of abuse.</p>
<p>However, the most common form of elder abuse is the failure to provide for the elderly person’s basic needs for food, water, rest and medications. Whether intentional or accidental, by law this is considered abandonment. For example, a formerly fastidious elder suddenly appears slovenly, utilities are turned off, the elder appears dehydrated or ravenous, or medical conditions, such as bedsores, appear. These are more scenarios may be indications of abuse.</p>
<p>In every case, always err on the side of caution. Ask questions of the elder and any caregivers. If your suspicions of abuse continue, contact the U.S. Administration on Aging&#8217;s National Center on Elder Abuse at 800-677-1116 to get help connecting with elder protective services.</p>
<p>If you suspect elder abuse in Missouri, seek help from a qualified elder law attorney.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10164145_s.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-853" src="http://qb-lawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10164145_s-300x276.jpg" alt="Incorporation" width="300" height="276" /></a></p>
<p>Business owners often turn to the legal process of incorporation to protect their personal assets from lawsuits; in essence, raising the ‘corporate shield’. Still, some of the best protective <a href="http://qb-lawfirm.com/areas-of-practice/corporate-business-law/">benefits of incorporation</a> are lost when corporate formalities are ignored.</p>
<p>These 5 tips will help you comply with basic rules of incorporation.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>“Inc.” is More Than a Name Extension</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>An incorporated business has the legal right to use “Inc.” after its name. Along with this right, using the “Inc.” designation is a protection, especially when the corporate name is used in writing. All contracts, letterhead, business cards, directory listings, advertising, checks, invoices, and more should use the full company name. Any document signatures should be accompanied by “Authorized Signature”, indicating that the signer has authority on behalf of the company.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong><em>Keep Business &amp; Personal Books Separate</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The corporation is a separate and distinct entity. Corporate affairs and personal affairs should never mix. Set up a corporate bank account and use this account only for business expenses and income.  Pay yourself from corporate funds, and then pay personal expenses to avoid comingling funds.  The corporation can lend money to the owner, or the owner to the corporation, but this loan must be well-documented and repaid as agreed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong><em>Don’t Skip Corporate Meetings</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Few business owners would argue that taxes must be paid. But what about stockholders’ meetings? Directors’ meetings? Many small companies fail to hold these meetings as necessary. If the company is audited by the IRS, they will want to see that the corporate bylaws outline meeting schedules and that minutes are kept.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong><em>Pay Corporate Debts</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For the best chance at success, a business needs capital. Corporations, in particular, require capital to avoid putting the company at financial and legal risk due to large or frequent withdrawals meant to satisfy dividends or payroll. Without capital, corporate officers may find themselves liable for authorizing such payments to stockholders before the company’s debts are paid.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong><em>Do the Paperwork</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Small corporations can sometimes file for exemptions from laws to which large corporations must adhere. But all corporations are held to certain standards which ensure compliance with state and federal securities laws. For example, a corporation cannot sell stock without SEC registration. Certain disclosures regarding the company’s financial position and associated risks must be provided to investors. Failure to comply with these and myriad laws can “pierce the corporate veil”, causing you to be held personally liable.</p>
<p>Clearly, respecting the corporate shield can preserve the very protection that incorporation provides. In Missouri, the knowledgeable business law attorneys of Quinn &amp; Banton are ready to answer your questions about incorporation.</p>
